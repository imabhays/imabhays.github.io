## Network Protocols

- These are rules for how devices communicate over a network. They're used in both software and hardware.

  
  - **Network Communications Protocols**: Allow devices to communicate over networks.(e.g., IP, TCP, HTTP)

  - **Network Security Protocols**: Secure data for authentication, integrity, and encryption. (e.g., SSH, SSL, TLS).

  - **Routing Protocols**: Help routers exchange route information and select the best path. (e.g., OSPF, BGP)

  - **Service Discovery Protocols**: Used for automatic detection of devices or services. (eg DHCP for IP address allocation, DNS for name-to-IP address translation)

- **Network Protocol Functions**: These protocols perform specific functions necessary for communication.

  - **Addressing**: Identifies sender and receiver of the message. (e.g., Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6)

  - **Reliability**: Provides guaranteed delivery if messages are lost or corrupted. (e.g., TCP)

  - **Flow control**: Ensures efficient data flow between two devices. Also provided by TCP. (e.g., TCP)

  - **Sequencing**: Labels each transmitted segment of data for correct reassembly. Useful if data is lost or received out-of-order. (e.g., TCP)

  - **Error Detection**: Determines if data was corrupted during transmission. (e.g., Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, TCP)

  - **Application Interface**: Contains information for process-to-process communications between network applications. HTTP or HTTPS are used for accessing a web page. (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS)

- **Protocol Interaction**: A message sent over a network typically requires several protocols, each with its own function.

  - **HTTP**: Governs how a web server and client interact. Defines content and formatting of requests and responses.

  - **TCP**: Manages conversations, guarantees reliable information delivery and manages flow control.

  - **IP**: Delivers messages from sender to receiver. Used by routers to forward messages across networks.

  - **Ethernet**: Delivers messages within the same Ethernet local area network (LAN).


## Models

- **OSI** and **TCP/IP** models help understand network concepts.
- They ensure different vendor products can work together.
- OSI model is great for explaining network concepts and troubleshooting.
- TCP/IP suite protocols are the current standards for networks.
- It's key to understand both models and how they relate.
- Usually, when discussing layers, we refer to the OSI model.
- When discussing protocols, we typically refer to the TCP/IP model.

### <u> OSI </u>

- The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe how different network protocols interact and work together to provide network services.

- The OSI model consists of seven different layers described below.

| OSI Model Layer | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 7 - Application | Where network-aware applications, such as web browsers or email clients, interact with the network. |
| 6 - Presentation | Translates the data format for the application, like converting text files from one code page to another, or encrypting and decrypting data. |
| 5 - Session | Establishes, manages, and terminates 'conversations' between networked applications. |
| 4 - Transport | Ensures data gets to the correct application at the destination and checks that all data has arrived. |
| 3 - Network | Determines the best path for data to take through the network from source to destination. |
| 2 - Data Link | Controls how data is sent to and received from the network, including error checking and correction. |
| 1 - Physical | Handles the physical transmission of data, including the network cabling and electrical signals. |

### <u> TCP/IP </u>

- TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.
- TCP/IP is the communication protocol for connecting network devices on the internet.
- It's an open standard, meaning no single company controls it.
- Unlike OSI, it was developed from real network implementations, making it the basis for the modern internet.
- The TCP/IP model has four key functional areas, each crucial for successful communication.

| TCP/IP Layer   | Function | Example Protocols |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Application    | Represents data to the user and controls dialogue | DNS, Telnet, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, DHCP, HTTP, FTP, SNMP |
| Transport      | Supports communication between diverse devices across diverse networks | TCP, UDP |
| Internet       | Determines the best path through the network | IP, ARP, ICMP |
| Network Access | Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network | Ethernet, Wireless |

## Physical Layer

### <u>Characteristics </u>

- **Physical Layer Standards**
  - Developed by various organizations such as ISO, TIA/EIA, ITU, ANSI, IEEE.
  - Standards govern hardware components like electronic circuitry, media, connectors.

- **Physical Components**
  - Examples: NICs, interfaces, connectors, cable materials.
  - Transmit signals representing bits.
  - Cisco 1941 router ports and interfaces are physical components specified by standards.

- **Encoding**
  - Examples: Manchester encoding, 4B/5B encoding, 8B/10B encoding.
  - Converts data bits into predefined code or pattern.
  - Enables recognition of data by sender and receiver.

- **Signaling**
  - Examples: Electrical, optical, or wireless signals.
  - Represents "1" and "0" on the media.
  - Signal types defined by standards (e.g., voltage levels, pulse durations).

- **Bandwidth**
  - Refers to data capacity of a medium.
  - Examples: kbps, Mbps, Gbps.
  - Determined by physical media properties and signaling technologies.


## Network Media Forms and Standards

Three basic forms of network media exist:
- Copper cable: The signals are patterns of electrical pulses.

- Fiber-optic cable: The signals are patterns of light.

- Wireless: The signals are patterns of microwave transmissions.


1. **Copper Cabling**:
- Characteristics: Copper cabling is affordable and easy to install for network connections.
- Types: Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP) cables.
- Example: Ethernet cables commonly use UTP for connecting devices.

	- **UTP Cabling:** (optional)
		- Properties: UTP cables are flexible, cost-effective, and use RJ-45 connectors.
		- Standards and Connectors: TIA/EIA-568 standards define wiring schemes. RJ-45 connectors terminate UTP cables.
		- Example: Straight-through cables connect different devices (e.g., computer to switch), while crossover cables connect similar devices (e.g., computer to computer).

2. **Fiber-Optic Cabling:**
- Properties: Fiber-optic cables use light for high-speed and long-distance data transmission.
- Types: Single-mode fiber (SMF) for long distances and multimode fiber (MMF) for shorter distances.
- Example: Fiber-optic cables are commonly used in high-speed networks and long-distance communication.

3. **Wireless Media:**
- Properties: Wireless media allows data transmission without cables, providing mobility.
- Types: Wi-Fi for local area networks, cellular networks for wider coverage.
- Example: Wireless LANs use Wi-Fi and access points for wireless device connectivity.

|                   | Antennas                |                            |                                |




## Data Link Layer Overview   

<br>
The Data Link Layer is the second layer in the OSI model, and it consists of two sub-layers:

1. **Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-layer**: Handles error correction, flow regulation, data framing, and addressing within the MAC sub-layer.
2. **Media Access Control (MAC) sub-layer**: Manages access to shared media, such as Token passing or Ethernet.

**<u> Key Functions of Data Link Layer </u>**:

- **Framing**: Transforms bit streams from the network layer into manageable frames.
- **Physical Addressing**: Inserts a header for identifying sender/receiver addresses when routing frames.
- **Flow Control**: Balances sender/receiver transmission rates, preventing receiver congestion.
- **Error Control**: Adds a trailer to frames for accuracy and avoidance of frame duplication.
- **Access Control**: Determines which device controls the link when multiple devices are connected.


## Data Link Layer

**Data Link Frame**

- Data Link Layer wraps data in a 'frame' with a header and trailer for local media transport.
- A frame has three parts: Header, Data, Trailer.
- Frame structure can change based on different protocols.
- The type and amount of control information in a frame depend on media and topology needs.

**Frame Fields include the following**

![image-center](/assets/images/bca/s3-cn/images/data-link1.png){: .align-center}{: width="500" }


- Start and stop flags: Mark the frame boundaries.
- Addressing: Shows where the frame comes from and where it's going.
- Type: Tells us the Layer 3 protocol in the data field.
- Control: Points out special flow control services, like QoS.
- Data: The actual information being transported.
- Error Detection: Checks if the frame arrived without mistakes.

**Layer 2 Addresses**

- Layer 2 uses physical addresses to transport a frame across local media.
- These addresses are unique to each device and don't show network location.
- Layer 2 addresses work within the same shared media and IP network.


## Difference between UDP and TCP


|   | TCP | UDP |
|---|-----|-----|
| **Connection** | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
| **Suitability** | High reliability applications, not critical of transmission delays (e.g., HTTP, HTTPs, FTP, SMTP, Telnet) | Fast, efficient transmission applications (e.g., DNS, DHCP, TFTP, SNMP, RIP, VOIP) |
| **Ordering of Data Packets** | Rearranges data packets in order | No inherent order; managed by the application layer |
| **Speed and Reliability** | Slower, but guarantees packet delivery | Faster, but no guarantee of delivery |
| **Header Size** | 20 bytes | 8 bytes |
| **Connection Setup** | Requires three packets to set up a socket connection | Lightweight, no connection tracking |
| **Flow Control** | Handles flow control, reliability, and congestion control | No option for flow control |
| **Error Checking** | Error checking and recovery present; retransmits erroneous packets | Error checking present, but discards erroneous packets without recovery |
| **Handshake** | Includes handshake process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) | No handshake (connectionless protocol) |

<br>

## TCP Handshake Procedure

- SYN (Synchronize): Initiates a connection.
- ACK (Acknowledgment): Acknowledges a received packet or confirms connection establishment.
- FIN : Terminates or closes a connection.

### TCP connection establishment (three-way handshake):
- Client sends a TCP segment with a SYN flag
- Server responds with a TCP segment with SYN and ACK flags
- Client responds with a TCP segment with an ACK flag.

### TCP four-way termination sequence
- Host A sends a TCP segment with ACK and FIN flags
- Host B responds with a TCP segment with an ACK flag
- Host B sends a TCP segment with ACK and FIN flags
- Host A responds with a TCP segment with an ACK flag
