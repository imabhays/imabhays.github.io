## 1. Luhn Formula, Check Digit, Luhn Algorithm, and Examples

- **Luhn Formula**: A simple checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, e.g., credit card numbers.
- **Check Digit**: The digit added to a number to ensure its validity based on the Luhn Algorithm.
- **Luhn Algorithm**: Process to calculate the check digit using the Luhn Formula.

**Luhn-10 Algorithm Steps:**
1. Start from the rightmost digit and move left.
2. Multiply every even-ranked digit by 2.
3. If a product is ≥10, add its digits.
4. Calculate the sum (s) of all resulting digits.

_Example: Credit card number 4532 0151 1283 0366_

**Tip:** You might be asked to find the check digit (right most). If check digit is 'c' and 'sum' is 's', the formula to find 'c' will be
**c = (10 - (s mod 10)) mod 10**\
In the example above, sum would be 44 and check digit can be calculated as c = (10 - (44 mod 10)) mod 10 = 6.

## 2. Functions, Representation, Examples, Sequences, and Excel

- **Function**: A relation between two sets, assigning each element in one set to exactly one element in the other.
- **Representation**: f(x) = y, f: X → Y
- **Example**: f(x) = 2x + 3
- **Sequence**: An ordered list of elements, often produced by a function.
- **Excel**: Use formulas to calculate function values, e.g., "=2*A1+3" where A1 is the input cell.

## 3. Ordered Pair

- A pair of elements written in a specific order, e.g., (x, y).
- Example: (3, 4) is different from (4, 3).

## 4. Relation, Domain & Range

- **Relation**: A set of ordered pairs.
- **Domain**: The set of all possible **input** values (x).
- **Range**: The set of all possible **output** values (y).
- **Example**: R = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)}; Domain = {1, 2, 3}; Range = {2, 3, 4}

## 5. Modulo Operator

- Calculates the remainder after division.
- Notation: a % b
- Example: 7 % 3 = 1

## 6. Hash Function

- A hash function is a function that takes an input and converts it into a fixed-size output.
- The main idea behind a hash function is to map a large amount of data to a smaller, more manageable size.

Example of a simple hash function for strings:
1. Goal: Map strings to numbers in the range 0-9.
2. Hash function: Add ASCII values of characters in the string, then take the remainder when divided by 10 (using modulo operation).

Example with "cat":
1. ASCII values: 'c'=99, 'a'=97, 't'=116
2. Sum: 99+97+116=312
3. Remainder: 312 % 10 = 2
4. Hash value: 2

## 7. Pseudorandom Numbers

- Numbers that appear random but are generated deterministically by an algorithm.
- Example: Linear congruential generator

## 8. Floor and Ceiling Functions

- **Floor function**: Rounds a number down to the nearest integer, e.g., floor(4.7) or ⌊4.7⌋ = 4.
- **Ceiling function**: Rounds a number up to the nearest integer, e.g., ceil(4.2) or ⌈4.2⌉= 5.

## 9. Encoding and Decoding Functions

- **Encoding**: Transforming data into a different format.
- **Decoding**: Reversing the encoding process.
- Example: Base64 encoding and decoding.

## 10. The Hamming Distance Function

- Measures the number of differing positions between two equal-length strings.


Example 1:\
String 1: 10101010\
String 2: 11101000\
Hamming distance: 3 (differences in positions 2, 8, and 9)

Example 2:\
String 1: AGCTAGC\
String 2: AGCTGGC\
Hamming distance: 1 (difference in position 5)

Example 3:\
String 1: 0000\
String 2: 1111\
Hamming distance: 4 (differences in all positions)

## 11. Boolean Functions
Functions that deal with truth values (True or False).\
Example: AND, OR, NOT, XOR operations.
