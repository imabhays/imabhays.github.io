## Congruence

- Congruence is a specific equality between numbers. 
- Two numbers are congruent if they have the same remainder when divided by another number.
- We use the symbol "≡" to represent congruence.

For example: `17 ≡ 5 (mod 4)` means that 17 and 5 have the same remainder (1) when divided by 4.

### Example:

Determine if 23 and 11 are congruent when divided by 6.

1. Divide 23 by 6. The remainder is 5.
2. Divide 11 by 6. The remainder is also 5.

Since both remainders are the same (5), we conclude that `23 ≡ 11 (mod 6)`.

## Multiplicative Inverse:
- A number that, when multiplied by another number, gives a product of 1. 
- For example, the multiplicative inverse of 4 is 1/4 because 4 * 1/4 = 1.

Now, let's learn about multiplicative inverse in the context of congruence (modular arithmetic).

### Step-by-step process to find the multiplicative inverse of 724 modulo 47 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:


1. (skip this step for now) Check if 724 and 47 are coprime. Since 724 = 2^3 * 181 and 47 is a prime number, they are coprime (GCD(724, 47) = 1).

We start with coefficients 0 and 1 because they represent the initial values for the identity **ax + by = GCD(a, b)**. In this case, 724 * 1 + 47 * 0 = 724, and 724 * 0 + 47 * 1 = 47.

2. Apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:


| Step |  Remainder  | Coefficient of 724(x) | Coefficient of 47(y) | Equation                    |
|------|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1    |     724     |         1             |         0            | 724*1 + 47*0 = 724          |
| 2    |      47     |         0             |         1            | 724*0 + 47*1 = 47           |
| 3    |      19     |         1             |       -15            | 724*1 + 47*(-15) = 19       |
| 4    |       9     |        -2             |        31            | 724*(-2) + 47*31 = 9        |
| 5    |       1     |         5             |       -77            | 724*5 + 47*(-77) = 1        |

3. From the table, we see that the value of 'x' = 5 is the modular multiplicative inverse of 724 modulo 47.

So, the multiplicative inverse of 724 modulo 47 is 5, as 724 * 5 ≡ 1 (mod 47).

Incase, you get negative value of 'x', add modulus to it to get positive inverse, Positive inverse = -x + 47.
