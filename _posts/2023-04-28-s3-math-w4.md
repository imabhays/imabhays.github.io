## 1. Set Theory

- Collection of distinct objects
- Union, intersection, and difference operations
- Example: A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {2, 3, 4}, A ‚à™ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}

## 2. Automata Theory

- Abstract machines, like finite automata, which can be used to model and analyze the behavior of systems
- Example: a simple vending machine that accepts only coins and dispenses a soda

## 3. Probability

- Likelihood of an event occurring
- P(A) = (favorable outcomes) / (total possible outcomes)
- Example: Probability of rolling a 6 on a fair die: P(6) = 1/6

## 4. Linear Algebra

- Study of vectors, matrices, and linear equations
- Solving systems of linear equations using matrices
- Example: Matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors

## 5. Graph

- Collection of nodes (vertices) and edges
- Directed or undirected
- Example: Social networks, web pages, road networks

## 6. Subset Sum Problem

- Determine if there exists a subset of given numbers that sum to a target value
- Example: S = {1, 2, 3, 4}, target = 5, solution = {1, 4}

## 7. Apriori Algorithm

- Identify frequent itemsets for association rule mining
- Example: Market basket analysis, finding frequent itemsets in sales data

## 8. Information Gain

- Measure of the reduction in uncertainty after splitting a dataset
- Used in decision tree algorithms
- Example: Selecting the best attribute to split a dataset in a decision tree
- Example 2: [^1]

## 10. Notations - Set Theory

- **Set:**\
Collection of distinct elements, denoted by uppercase letters (`A`, `B`, `C`)
- **Element:**\
Individual items within a set, represented by lowercase letters (`a`, `b`, `c`)
- **Membership notation:**\
`a ‚àà A` (a is an element of set A)
- **Not a member notation:**\
`a ‚àâ B` (a is not an element of set B)
- **Subset:**\
All elements of A are in B, denoted `A ‚äÜ B`
- **Proper subset:**\
Subset not equal to the original set, denoted `A ‚äÇ B`
- **Superset:**\
Set A contains all elements of set B, denoted `A ‚äá B`
- **Universal set:**\
Contains all elements under consideration, denoted `U` or `Œ©`
- **Empty set (Null set):**\
Set with no elements, denoted `‚àÖ` or `{}`
- **Intersection:**\
Set of elements common to A and B, denoted `A ‚à© B`
- **Union:**\
Set of all elements in A and B, denoted `A ‚à™ B`
- **Difference:**\
Set of elements in A but not in B, denoted `A - B` or `A \ B`
- **Complement:**\
Set of elements in universal set U but not in A, denoted `A'` or `A^c`
- **Cardinality:**\
Number of elements in a set, denoted `|A|`
- **Power set:**\
Set of all subsets of A, including empty set and A itself, denoted `P(A)` or `2^A`

## 11. Specifying Sets

- **Listing method:**\
Enumerate elements, e.g., A = {1, 2, 3}
- **Set-builder notation:**\
Define by properties, e.g., B = {x \| x > 0, x ‚àà Z}
- **Characteristic function:**\
Indicator function, e.g.,ùúí_A(x) = 1 if x ‚àà A, 0 otherwise
- **Recursive formula:**\
Define via recursion, e.g., Fibonacci sequence: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

## 12. Types of Sets

- Null set: {}
- Singleton set: {1}
- Finite set: {1, 2, 3}
- Infinite set: N (natural numbers)
- Equivalent sets: same number of elements
- Equal sets: same elements
- Subset: A ‚äÜ B
- Superset: A ‚äá B
- Universal set: U
- Power set: P(A), set of all subsets of A

## 13. Venn Diagram and Set Operations

- Venn Diagram: Visual representation of sets and their relationships
- Set operations: Union, intersection, difference, and complement

## 14. Venn Diagram - Example [^2]

## 15. Venn Diagram - Subset and Superset

- Subset: Set A is a subset of B if all elements of A are also in B
- Superset: Set A is a superset of B if A contains all elements of B

## 16. Set Operations

- Union: A ‚à™ B, all elements in either A or B
- Intersection: A ‚à© B, all elements in both A and B
- Difference: A - B, all elements in A but not in B

## 17 Venn Diagram Applications

- Various applications of Venn diagrams in research and analysis like
  - Bioinformatics (gene overlaps, protein interactions)
  - Social network analysis (shared connections)
  - Market segmentation (customer overlap)
- Visualizing relationships, intersections, and unions
