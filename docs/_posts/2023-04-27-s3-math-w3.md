### Logic Puzzle 1

An island has two inhabitants: knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie. You go to the island and meet A and B. A says, "At least one of us is a Knave". B is silent.

- P: A is a Knight
- Q: B is a Knight

| P   | Q   | ¬P  | ¬Q  | ¬P ∨ ¬Q | P⟺(¬P ∨ ¬Q) |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|------------|
| T   | T   | F   | F   | F      | F          |
| T   | F   | F   | T   | T      | T          |
| F   | T   | T   | F   | T      | F          |
| F   | F   | T   | T   | T      | F          |

**Answer**: A is a Knight, and B is a Knave.

### Logic Puzzle 2

A says, "At least one of us is a Knave". B says, "A is a Knave".

- P: A is a Knight
- Q: B is a Knight

| P   | Q   | ¬P  | ¬Q  | ¬P ∨ ¬Q | P⟺(¬P ∨ ¬Q) | Q⟺¬P | (P⟺(¬P ∨ ¬Q)) ∧ (Q⟺¬P) |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|------------|------|------------------------|
| T   | T   | F   | F   | F      | F          | F    | F                      |
| T   | F   | F   | T   | T      | T          | T    | T                      |
| F   | T   | T   | F   | T      | F          | F    | F                      |
| F   | F   | T   | T   | T      | F          | T    | F                      |

**Answer**: A is a Knight, and B is a Knave.

### Logic Puzzle 3

A says, "B is a knight". B says, "The two of us are of opposite types".

- P: A is a Knight
- Q: B is a Knight

| P   | Q   | P⟺Q | ¬P⟺Q | P⟺(P⟺Q) | Q⟺(¬P⟺Q) | (P⟺(P⟺Q)) ∧ (Q⟺(¬P⟺Q)) |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|--------|------------------------|
| T   | T   | T   | F   | T      | F      | F                      |
| T   | F   | F   | T   | F      | T      | F                      |
| F   | T   | F   | T   | F      | F      | F                      |
| F   | F   | T   | F   | T      | T      | T                      |

**Answer**: A is a Knight, and B is a Knave.

### Boolean Search

- Developed by George Boole
- Search keywords are combined by operators: AND, OR, NOT
- Use parentheses () to group keywords
- Use quotation marks to search for exact phrases
- Use an asterisk * as a wildcard to search for variations of a word

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Semantics and Meaning Representation

- NLP focuses on understanding human language.
- Semantics: study of meaning in language.
- Meaning Representation: uses propositional and predicate logic to represent the meaning of natural language sentences.

### Propositional Logic

- Represents simple statements and relationships between them.
- Example: P: "It is raining." Q: "I will use an umbrella." P → Q (If it is raining, I will use an umbrella.)

### Predicate Logic

- Also known as First-Order Logic.
- Extension of propositional logic.
- Introduces predicates and quantification.

Example:

- Predicate: E(x): "x is even"
- Quantifiers: ∀ (universal) and ∃ (existential)
- ∀x E(x): "All numbers are even."
- ∃x E(x): "There exists an even number."


### First-Order Logic

- An extension of propositional logic that introduces predicates and quantifiers.
- More expressive than propositional logic.

#### Quantifiers

- Quantifiers express the extent to which a predicate holds.
- There are two types of quantifiers in FOL:
  - Universal Quantifier (∀): Indicates that a predicate holds for all elements in the domain.
  - Existential Quantifier (∃): Indicates that a predicate holds for at least one element in the domain.

#### Examples

1. ∀x L(x, y): "Everyone loves y."
2. ∃x L(x, y): "There is someone who loves y."
3. ∀x ∃y L(x, y): "Everyone loves at least one person."
4. ∃x ∀y L(x, y): "There is someone who loves everyone."

In summary, First-Order Logic allows for more complex and detailed relationships compared to propositional logic using predicates with arguments and quantifiers.

### Syntactic Analysis

- Breaking down a sentence into its components (nouns, verbs, etc.)
- Example:

![image-center](/assets/images/bca/syntactic.jpg){: .align-center}{: width="500" }

### Context-Free Grammar

- Uses production rules to generate valid strings in a language.
- Example: Arithmetic expressions.

```
Start symbol: <expression>
Terminal symbols: {+, -, *, /, (, ), number}

Production rules:
<expression> → number
<expression> → (<expression>)
<expression> → <expression> + <expression>
<expression> → <expression> - <expression>
<expression> → <expression> * <expression>
<expression> → <expression> / <expression>
```

Example: (2 + 3) * 5 is a valid string according to the grammar rules.
