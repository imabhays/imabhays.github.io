### What is Frequent Patterns?

- Patterns that appear frequently in a dataset.
- Sets of items that commonly occur together in transactions.
- Example: {milk, bread} is a frequent itemset if customers often buy them together.

### Define Frequent Itemset Mining

- Identifies and lists itemsets that meet a minimum support threshold.
- Important for tasks like association rule mining and correlation mining.
- Aims to find relationships between items in large datasets.

### Association Rule

- Association rules find interesting relations between variables in large databases.
- They identify strong rules based on measures of interestingness.
- Example: "If a customer buys a coffee, they are 80% likely to also purchase a muffin."

### Market Basket Analysis

- Modelling technique that explores item associations in shopping baskets.
- Used by retailers to uncover item relationships.
- Analyzes frequent co-occurrences of items in transactions.
- Example: Customers buying computers often purchase antivirus software, suggesting strategic product placement.

### Name Applications of Frequent Pattern Mining

- <u>Data Preprocessing and Noise Filtering</u>:
  - Helps filter out noise and clean data.
  - Distinguishes frequent item co-occurrences from random noise.

- <u>Discovery of Inherent Structures and Clusters</u>:
  - Reveals hidden structures and clusters in data.
  - Identifies coauthor and conference clusters in DBLP data set.

- <u>Pattern-based Classification</u>:
  - Constructs reliable classification models using frequent patterns.
  - Provides more information gain compared to infrequent patterns.

- <u>Subspace Clustering in High-Dimensional Space</u>:
  - Supports effective clustering in high-dimensional space.
  - Overcomes challenges of measuring distances in such spaces.

- <u>Microarray Data Analysis</u>:
  - Analyzes noisy microarray data with thousands of dimensions.
  - Helps differentiate noise from meaningful patterns.

- <u>Semantic Annotation of Frequent Patterns</u>:
  - Enhances understanding of frequent patterns with annotations.
  - Provides additional context and meaning to the patterns.


### Applications of Market Basket Analysis

- <u>Marketing and Advertising Strategies</u>:
  - Tailoring marketing efforts based on frequently bought together products.
  - Optimizing advertising strategies using market basket analysis insights.

- <u>Store Layout Design</u>:
  - Placing frequently purchased items together in store layout.
  - Utilizing strategic placement to maximize sales and customer experience.

- <u>Sales Planning</u>:
  - Identifying items to put on sale based on frequent associations.
  - Promoting complementary items to boost sales.

- <u>Catalog Design</u>:
  - Grouping frequently bought together items in catalogs.
  - Enhancing catalog layout for increased sales potential.

- <u>Cross-Marketing</u>:
  - Utilizing correlations to make effective cross-marketing decisions.
  - Understanding product associations to drive sales across different categories.

- <u>Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis</u>:
  - Analyzing buying habits and preferences of customers.
  - Improving shopping experience and increasing sales based on insights.



### Frequent Itemset Mining Methods

- **Apriori Algorithm**:
  - Mines frequent itemsets for Boolean association rules.
  - Uses the Apriori property and iterative approach.
  - Forms candidate itemsets based on frequent (k-1)-itemsets.
  - Scans the database to find complete sets of frequent itemsets.
  - Variations include hashing, transaction reduction, partitioning, and sampling for efficiency improvement.

- **Frequent Pattern Growth (FP-growth)**:
  - Mines frequent itemsets without candidate generation.
  - Constructs a compact FP-tree data structure.
  - Compresses the transaction database.
  - Focuses on frequent pattern growth rather than generate-and-test.
  - Offers improved efficiency compared to Apriori-like methods.

### Mining Association Rules

Mining association rules involves several steps:

- **Finding Frequent Itemsets**:
  - Identify itemsets (e.g., A and B) that meet a minimum support threshold.
  - Support threshold ensures sufficient occurrence in the data.

- **Generating Strong Association Rules**:
  - Generate association rules (A -> B) from frequent itemsets.
  - Rules meet a minimum confidence threshold.
  - Confidence indicates the probability of B given A.

- **Uncovering Correlation Rules**:
  - Analyze associations to uncover correlation rules.
  - Reveal statistical correlations between itemsets A and B.

- **Classifying Algorithms**:
  - Efficient and scalable algorithms for mining frequent itemsets.
  - Three categories: Apriori-like, FP-growth, and vertical data format.

- **Evaluating Patterns**:
  - Augment support-confidence framework with pattern evaluation.
  - Evaluate interestingness of association rules.
  - Consider null-invariant measures (unaffected by null-transactions).
  - Common measures: lift, Ï‡2, all confidence, max confidence, Kulczynski, cosine.
