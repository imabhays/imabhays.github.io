### Data Mining

- Data Mining, also known as Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD), is a process used to extract valuable information from large sets of data. 

- It involves various aspects such as:
  - **Data Types**: Includes relational, transactional, data warehouse data, and complex data types like time-series, sequences, data streams, spatiotemporal data, multimedia data, text data, graphs, social networks, and Web data.
  
  - **Knowledge Mined**: Involves discovering patterns, associations, correlations, and causal structures.
  
  - **Technologies Used**: Incorporates machine learning, statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, and visualization.
  
  - **Applications**: Extensively used in various fields such as business, science, engineering, and healthcare.

- **Major challenges**
    - scalability, 
    - handling different types of attributes, 
    - dealing with noisy data, and 
    - developing incremental clustering algorithms.

### Summarize about the steps in Knowledge Discovery Process

   - <u>Data Cleaning:</u> Remove noise and inconsistent data.
   - <u>Data Integration:</u> Combine multiple data sources.
   - <u>Data Selection:</u> Data relevant to the analysis task are retrieved from the database.
   - <u>Data Transformation:</u> Consolidate data into mining-friendly formats.
   - <u>Data Mining:</u> Apply intelligent methods to uncover patterns.
   - <u>Pattern Evaluation:</u> Identify valuable patterns via interestingness measures.
   - <u>Knowledge Presentation:</u> Visualization and knowledge representation techniques are used to present the mined knowledge.

### Briefly summarize about "Transactional Data"
- Refers to the data that records an exchange, agreement or transfer between entities.
- Captures every system event detail.
- Examples: order delivery, purchase orders, invoices.

### Explain different Data Mining Functionalities
- <u>Characterization/Discrimination:</u> Summarize and contrast data.
- <u>Association/Correlation:</u> Find relationships in data.
- <u>Classification/Regression:</u> Create data models and predict labels.
- <u>Cluster Analysis:</u> Group data into clusters.
- <u>Outlier Analysis:</u> Identify non-compliant data.
- <u>Trend/Evolution:</u> Describe trends over time.

### What is a "Data Warehouse"? Explain the importance of DW in data mining field.

**Data Warehouse**
- Collects and manages data from various sources.
- Enables strategic data use through a mix of technologies and components.
- Offers consistent business view, irrespective of data source.
- Acts as electronic storage for large information volumes.
- Designed for query and analysis rather than transaction processing.
- Transforms data into information for user analysis.

**Important reasons for using Data warehouse**
- Integrates many sources of data and helps to decrease stress on a production system.
- Optimized Data for reading access and consecutive disk scans.
- Data Warehouse helps to protect Data from the source system upgrades.
- Allows users to perform master Data Management.
- Improve data quality in source systems.

### What are the issues faced in Data mining?
- <u>Mining Methodology:</u> Managing diverse data types, noise, uncertainty, scalability.
- <u>User Interaction:</u> Maintaining simplicity, transparency, and user engagement.
- <u>Efficiency and Scalability:</u> Ensuring fast, scalable data processing.
- <u>Diversity of Database Types:</u> Handling various data types and sources.
- <u>Data Mining and Society:</u> Navigating information misuse, privacy, security.
