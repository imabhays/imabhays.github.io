My name is Abhay Singh, and I have a strong background in the creative field. However, I have decided to pivot my career towards the technical field, with a particular focus on information security. Currently, I am a student pursuing a [Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA)](/bca-resources.md) from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, where I am building a solid foundation in computer science principles.

I maintain this site to document my learnings, write technical articles, and create knowledge base every semester for fellow students. 

My ultimate focus is to work in application security, and I am putting all my efforts into achieving this goal.  Additionally, I am preparing for CCNA certification to enhance my knowledge and skills in data and cyber security.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me.<br>
